        <h2>About.</h2>

        <p>Since I was young, I have always had a passion for coding and web development, beginning with creating html and css layouts on sites such as mySpace, Neopets, Gaia Online, and Tumblr.</p>
        <p>Now as a thinkful student, I am excited to finally begin my journey of becoming a real web developer! Thank you, Thinkful!</p>
        <p>Outside of my love for coding, I am also an avid gamer and love cooking recipes from cultures around the world.</p>
